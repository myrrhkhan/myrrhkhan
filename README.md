## Hi! :)

I'm Myrrh Khan (he/him) and I'm currently a sophomore CS student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Massachusetts. I've been programming since the begining of my sophomore year of high school in 2019.

### Summary:
 - Proficient in Java Python, C/C++, and x86 Assembly. Experienced with robotics programming and machine learning (particularly Tensorflow). Also experienced with Racket.
 - Currently creating a side project to learn HTML, CSS, TypeScript, the Svelte frontend framework, and the basics of Rust. Check out my repo [here](github.com/myrrhkhan/VarEdit).

### Bio:

I started programming in Java through my high school's FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team. When I joined, the programming subteam's size was 5x larger than the previous year, so I found myself learning much of the programming on my own. Much of programming started to click at the start of the COVID pandemic, when I had more time to program. 

I began my Python journey on my own by experimenting with code to graph COVID-19 data, and later, at the suggestion of a family member, started learning Tensorflow and running neural networks on images. During this time, as my team met virtually, my teammates would share our personal projects and teach other teammates how to program in those languages, allowing me to teach machine learning and find gaps in my own knowledge while also being taught more advanced concepts in robot programming. I was also put in charge of adapting our programming subteam's workflow transition to COVID, therefore strengthening my skills in Git and allowing me to learn more about GitHub's features. During my senior year, I taught my team how to use GitHub's pull request features to better organize our workflow.

During my first term of college, I took an introductory class in a language known as Racket, which is a language with a lisp style of syntax. Though I initially went into the class confused as to how it be applicable in the real world, I found it to be extremely enlightening when learning about the concept of lambdas, recursion, and just functional programming in general, as the majority of my experience was in OOP.

### Here are some of my in-progress projects to look out for ðŸ‘€:
 - [VarEdit](github.com/myrrhkhan/VarEdit), a GUI to edit environment variables built with Tauri, an Electron alternative. My backend is in Rust and I'm using Svelte as my frontend.
 
### Long-term projects:
 
 - I aim to improve on my ML programming by diving deeper into the concepts behind neural networks rather than just the code. One recent ML project I did was performing sentiment analysis on song lyrics using a pretrained model, and I will expand on that by training my own models to refresh my ML skills.
 - My profile has many abandoned projects from high school, and as time has went on, I've become much more proactive in keeping up with my projects. I hope to uncover the dust on a project that aims to connect announcements from Slack to Discord. I also hope to bring up a fairly simple C++ project for my old robotics team to use.
 - I will develop a concept redesign of the Worcester Regional Transit Authority (WRTA) website with my roommate. We'll be using PostgreSQL and GraphQL with Apollo, Express, and NodeJS for our backend, and we'll be using React with TypeScript (along with HTML/CSS) for our frontend. Though this is a personal project, it sprouted from a research project I did during my first semester of college where we investigated issues with the local bus system.
